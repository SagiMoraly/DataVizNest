1.Visualize the distribution of users' ages using a bar chart to show how many users fall into each age group.
PieChart
"18-29", "30-39", "40-49", "50-59", "60-69", "70-79", "80-90"
{
    id:Age1829
    value:number of users
}

2.Create a scatter plot with age on the x-axis and starting balance on the y-axis. Each point represents a user, showing the relationship between age and starting balance.
ScatterPlot https://nivo.rocks/scatterplot/

{
    id:Age1829
    staringbalance:number
}

3.Use box plots to display the income distribution for different age groups, helping to highlight the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.
BoxPlot https://nivo.rocks/boxplot/
  {
    group: "Alpha",
    subgroup: "A",
    mu: 5,
    sd: 1,
    n: 20,
    value: 4.6483261970788305,
  },
?

4.Create a stacked bar chart to display the distribution of income sources for each age group, showcasing how income composition varies.
Bar https://nivo.rocks/bar/

{
    country: "AD",
    "hot dog": 137,
    "hot dogColor": "hsl(229, 70%, 50%)",
    burger: 96,
    burgerColor: "hsl(296, 70%, 50%)",
    kebab: 72,
    kebabColor: "hsl(97, 70%, 50%)",
    donut: 140,
    donutColor: "hsl(340, 70%, 50%)",
  }

5.Plot the total income for each year over time using a line chart, illustrating trends and fluctuations.
Line https://nivo.rocks/line/

[
      {
    id: "18-29",
    color: tokens("dark").blueAccent[300],
    data: [
      {
        x: "2020",
        y: 101,
      },
      {
        x: "2021",
        y: 75,
      },
      {
        x: "2022",
        y: 36,
      },
      {
        x: "2023",
        y: 216,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "29-39",
    color: tokens("dark").redAccent[200],
    data: [
      {
        x: "2020",
        y: 212,
      },
      {
        x: "2021",
        y: 190,
      },
      {
        x: "2022",
        y: 270,
      },
      {
        x: "2023",
        y: 9,
      },

    ],
  },...
]

6.Visualize the correlation matrix between numerical variables (e.g., age, starting balance, income) using a heatmap.
HeatMap https://nivo.rocks/heatmap/

?Present a pie chart showing the proportion of expenses across different categories to visualize spending patterns.
cool but hard ?Use a bar chart to show the progress of users' savings goals over time, with bars representing the current amount saved towards the target.





future: 
page for each some in the front page maybe live user adding ***

    list of data needed from server for front end

    make the sql querys into seprate file
    add try and except 

    delete all unnecessary library 
    cleanup for code
